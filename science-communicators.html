<h1>Science Communicators in STEM: Shaping Public Perceptions</h1>

<p>
Whenever people hear the words <strong>"Electric Cars," "Solar power," and "Windmills,"</strong>
they often respond with phrases like “So cool,” “Saviour of the environment,” and “Sustainable future.”
On the other hand, when they hear the word <strong>"Mining of Minerals,"</strong> the immediate associations are
“Dirty,” “Exploitation,” “Environmental degradation,” and “Pollution.”
But how accurate are these impressions?
What understanding might be missing — or what shaped these perceptions in the first place?
</p>

<p>
Every day, people rely on countless elements from the periodic table through electronics,
automobiles, infrastructure, and industrial materials. Where are these materials coming from?
Mining is not separate from sustainability — it is a core enabler of it.
</p>

<p>
So, what role do engineers have in influencing public thought?
A significant one. We are responsible for improving awareness, simplifying complex ideas,
and enabling people to make informed judgments about the technologies and materials that shape society.
</p>

<p>
Communication should be simple and accessible — not guilt-driven.
The goal is to help people understand reality, environmental trade-offs, and the
importance of responsible decisions. After proper awareness, when someone hears “Mining,”
their perception may become more neutral and balanced, recognizing how essential
mined minerals are for the very technologies they consider “green.”
</p>

<p>
Mining is just one example. Many scientific and engineering fields need clear,
responsible communication that bridges the gap between experts and everyday people.
Let us make micro contributions to build a more informed and responsible world.
